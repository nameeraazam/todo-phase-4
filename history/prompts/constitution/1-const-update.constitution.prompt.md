# Constitution Update for Todo AI Chatbot (Spec-4)

## User Input

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

Updated the project constitution to align with Spec-4 requirements for the Todo AI Chatbot. The new constitution emphasizes:

1. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
2. Stateless Backend Architecture
3. MCP Tool-Based Task Management
4. Natural Language Interface
5. Conversation Persistence
6. MCP Tool Compliance

Also updated dependent templates:
- plan-template.md: Added constitution check requirements
- spec-template.md: Added constitution alignment section
- tasks-template.md: Added constitution compliance tasks

The constitution now properly reflects the requirements for a stateless, MCP tool-based AI chatbot system while maintaining the Spec-Driven Development approach.
